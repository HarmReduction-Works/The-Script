## Meeting Begins

Welcome to Harm Reduction Works. My name is _________________ and I am your host for today’s meeting. 

This is an open group. Everyone is welcome. If you have been totally abstinent and/or participate in other types of groups, you are welcome.  If you are using or drinking, you are welcome. If abstinence is your goal, or if abstinence is not your goal, you are welcome here. If you are friends or family of someone who is using or drinking, you are welcome here. If you work as a harm reductionist, in any capacity, you are welcome here. 
If you want to learn more about harm reduction for any reason, you are welcome here. 

Will the person who has “HRW#1 - Welcome to Harm Reduction Works” read our welcoming statement?

> We accept people have a relationship with drugs and alcohol. Some people take drugs or drink for fun. Some people take drugs or drink to make to make a good feeling, feel even better… or to make a bad feeling, feel tolerable. Some people enjoy drugs or drinking only occasionally. Some people need drugs or alcohol to function. Some people try to avoid taking any type of drug or drinking for any reason. In a way, avoidance is still a way to have a relationship with drugs and alcohol. Some people find their drug use or drinking leads to troubling issues. Still others use drugs or drink and have no major consequences. Sometimes people are not concerned by the consequences at all.
>
> In general, consequences for drug use and drinking fall into four broad categories:
> 
> - **Health**. This refers to both physical and mental health.
> - **Legal**. Many drugs are illegal. Simple possession or open containers can carry mandatory sentences or fines. The major weapons of The War on Drugs are arrest and incarceration.
> - **Social**. Relationships with others may change or deteriorate to the point of frequent isolation and loneliness.
> - **Financial**. Usually there is a financial cost associated with drug use and drinking. Drugs and alcohol cost money. Many employers require drug tests to get or keep a job.
>
> When issues start to rise in one, some or all these broad areas, this is a key time for connection and community. 
> 
> **You are in the right place.**

Harm reduction includes all paths to recovery, as defined by each person in their own way. This includes moderation, continued use with the use of harm reduction, as well as abstinence from all substances. No path is better or worse than another. The point is, we can talk about alcohol and substance use, the harms associated with their use, and how to reduce these harms - without confrontation- in ways that are respectful, kind, compassionate, and free of moral judgement. Sometimes these conversations are incredibly difficult. What harm reduction teaches us is to talk with others without judgement and to listen deeply to the stories people share. 

Will the person who has offered to read “HRW#2 - You’re the Expert in Your Own Life” please continue with our welcome?

> Looking at ourselves means figuring out what works and doesn’t work. Often, this leads to some kind of goal. In general, we find goals often fall into one or some
combination of the following categories:
>
> - **Amount**. How much you use, and when you use or drink. Sometimes just paying attention to how much is consumed can change behavior in ways that reduce harm.
> - **Frequency**. How often you use or drink. Some people have to use or drink every day, or they go into withdrawal. Becoming aware of frequency can give people the chance to change a pattern when they are ready.
> - **Method**. How drugs are consumed. Sterile equipment reduces risk of hepatitis and HIV and soft tissue wounds. Going slow can reduce risk of overdose. Having water between drinks helps people stay hydrated. Goals are not always the same for everyone because priorities, needs, wants and desires are not the same
for everyone. Goals are personal because everybody’s story and circumstances are different.
>
> Listen non-judgementally to your peers when they are sharing! Please let the person speaking complete their thoughts and generally avoid interruption. Feedback may be offered, but it can be politely refused before or during feedback. This is not the place to argue or debate. We are here to support each other and explore the use of substances in our lives and the decisions we are accountable and autonomous to make on behalf of ourselves!

>**The only right path for any of us is the one we choose, Each of us is the expert in our own lives!!!**
