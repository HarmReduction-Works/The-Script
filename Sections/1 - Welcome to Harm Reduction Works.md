Welcome To Harm Reduction Works
We accept people have a relationship with drugs and alcohol. Some people take drugs or drink for fun. Some people take drugs or drink to make to make a good feeling, feel even betterâ€¦ or to make a bad feeling, feel tolerable. Some people enjoy drugs or drinking only occasionally. Some people need drugs or alcohol to function. Some people try to avoid taking any type of drug or drinking for any reason. In a way, avoidance is still a way to have a relationship with drugs and alcohol. Some people find their drug use or drinking leads to troubling issues. Still others use drugs or drink and have no major consequences. Sometimes people are not concerned by the consequences at all.

In general, consequences for drug use and drinking fall into four broad categories:

**Health**. This refers to both physical and mental health.
**Legal**. Many drugs are illegal. Simple possession or open containers can carry mandatory sentences or fines. The major weapons of The War on Drugs are arrest and incarceration.
**Social**. Relationships with others may change or deteriorate to the point of frequent isolation and loneliness.
**Financial**. Usually there is a financial cost associated with drug use and drinking. Drugs and alcohol cost money. Many employers require drug tests to get or keep a job.

When issues start to rise in one, some or all these broad areas, this is a key time for connection and community.

You are in the right place.
