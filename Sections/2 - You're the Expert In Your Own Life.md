# You're The Expert In Your Own Life

Looking at ourselves means figuring out what works and doesn’t work. Often, this leads to some kind of goal. In general, we find goals often fall into one or some combination of the following categories:

- **Amount**. How much you use, and when you use or drink. Sometimes just paying attention to how much is consumed can change behavior in ways that reduce harm.
- **Frequency**. How often you use or drink. Some people have to use or drink every day, or they go into withdrawal. Becoming aware of frequency can give people the chance to change a pattern when they are ready.
- **Method**. How drugs are consumed. Sterile equipment reduces risk of hepatitis and HIV and soft tissue wounds. Going slow can reduce risk of overdose. Having water between drinks helps people stay hydrated. Goals are not always the same for everyone because priorities, needs, wants and desires are not the same for everyone. Goals are personal because everybody’s story and circumstances are different.

Listen non-judgementally to your peers when they are sharing! Please let the person speaking complete their thoughts and generally avoid interruption. Feedback may be offered, but it can be politely refused before or during feedback. This is not the place to argue or debate. We are here to support each other and explore the use of substances in our lives and the decisions we are accountable and autonomous to make on behalf of ourselves!

The only right path for any of us is the one we choose, Each of us is the expert in our own lives!!!
