# You're The Expert In Your Own Life

We are concerned more about how you look at your child’s or ward’s drug using and drinking than what goals you might have for yourself or for them to change. Of
those who choose abstinence, some will abstain only from one substance. Others might abstain from all mind altering substances. Still others might choose to continue
to use or drink. Looking at ourselves and our relationship with our children or wards means figuring out what works and doesn’t work, what only works partly or what
might work better. Often, this leads to some kind of hope and if it does, that’s great too. In general we find hopes for a loved one’s drinking or using sometimes fall into
one or some combination of the following categories:

- *Amount*. How much is used when using or drinking. Sometimes just paying attention to how much is consumed can change behavior in ways that reduce harm.
- *Method*. How drugs are consumed. Sterile equipment reduces risk of hepatitis and HIV and soft tissue wounds. Going slow can reduce risk of overdose. Having water between drinks helps people stay hydrated.
- *Frequency*. How often people use or drink. Some people have to use or drink everyday or they go into withdrawal. Some people only like to use at night or only on weekends. Sometimes frequency changes depending on the type of drugs or alcohol consumed. Sometimes patterns change when a person’s environment is different. Becoming aware of frequency can give people the chance to change a pattern when change makes sense to them and they are ready.

Hopes are not always the same for everyone because priorities, needs, wants and desires are not the same for everyone. Hopes are personal because everybody’s story and circumstances are different.

Everyone is welcome unless this is a focused group for people who are parents and guardians to people who currently or have history of personal use of drugs and alcohol or are considering using drugs or drinking.
 
** (OPTIONAL FOR FOCUSED GROUPS: If you are not in a parenting or guardian role and this is a focused group, we respectf ully ask you to participate in the meeting as a witness only.)**

Feedback can be offered but it can be politely refused at anytime before or during feedback. Please let the person speaking complete their thoughts and generally avoid interruption. This is not the place to argue or debate. We are here to support each other and explore our lives. The only right path for any of us is the one we choose. Each of us is the expert in our own lives.
